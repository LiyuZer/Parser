My Chill Parser

Welcome to my parser! This isn't just any parser – it's built with love, thoughtfulness, and a pinch of chaos. Whether you're here to see how it works, borrow some ideas, or just judge my code (go easy on me), you're in the right place.

Why Did I Build This?

Because I could. Seriously, though, I was building Automa, my graph-based programming language, and the parser became a key piece of the puzzle. I wanted something lightweight, highly extensible, and built from scratch. ANTLR? Too heavy. Generic libraries? Too limiting. So, I rolled up my sleeves and said, "Let's do this my way."

Key Features

Extensibility: New grammar rules? Custom tokens? Dynamic rule creation? Done. Add what you need and keep moving.

Efficiency: Parsing doesn't have to be slow or convoluted. My parser gets the job done without making your CPU cry.

Modularity: It's built to be clean and hackable. Tweak one piece without worrying about breaking the rest.

Stack-based Parsing: No magic. Just a simple std::stack approach that’s easy to follow and extend.

Dynamic Rule Handling: Parentheses? Import statements? Arithmetic? You can dynamically define rules and tokens as you need them. Pure plug-and-play vibes.

How It Works

At its core, the parser uses an execution stack to process rules. Here's the general flow:

Tokens: The lexer splits your input into tokens. These tokens feed into the parser.

Rules: The parser checks the current token against your defined rules. If it matches, it’s pushed to the stack.

Dynamic Expansion: Need a new rule for a subexpression? No problem. The parser dynamically creates and applies rules on the fly.

Final AST: Once everything is parsed, you get a clean, hierarchical Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to work with.

Usage

Want to try it out? Here’s a quick guide to get you started:

Clone the Repo

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-parser.git
cd your-parser

Build

Make sure you have a modern C++ compiler (I'm looking at you, g++ and clang++) installed.

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

Run

Pass in a sample input file to see the parser in action:

./parser input.txt

Customize

Want to add new rules or tokens? Just edit the rules map in the source code. It’s that simple.

What I’m Proud Of

Handcrafted: Every line is my own, from the lexer to the stack-based parsing logic. No shortcuts.

Ambiguity Tolerance: The parser handles ambiguous grammars gracefully. It’s built for flexibility.

Dynamic Everything: Adding new features is a breeze. You’re never locked into predefined behavior.

What You Might Find Cool (or Annoying)

The grammar is intentionally ambiguous, so it’s great for experimentation but might feel a bit wild.

Error handling is… a work in progress. But hey, the logs are detailed, so debugging isn’t too painful.

Where I’m Taking This

This parser is a critical part of Automa, my graph-based programming language. But it’s also a standalone project that can handle:

Custom DSLs

Scripting languages

Anything else you want to throw at it

Contributing

Want to improve it? Found a bug? Send in a PR or drop an issue. I’m open to collaborations and feedback.

Why This Parser Matters (for Jobs, wink)

If you're reading this, chances are you care about clean, extensible code and innovative solutions. I built this parser not just as a tool but as a showcase of my abilities. It's proof that I can:

Build complex systems from scratch

Solve tough problems with creative solutions

Write clean, modular, and maintainable code

Final Thoughts

Check it out, play with it, and let me know what you think. Whether it’s for a job, collaboration, or just fun, this parser is my way of showing that code can be functional, beautiful, and a little bit quirky – just like its creator.

Enjoy!
